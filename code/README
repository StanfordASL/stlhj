%% Installation %%
1. HJ Reachability Computation (C++):
   - The computation uses the beacls C++ toolbox, which can be found here: https://github.com/HJReachability/beacls/tree/master/sources
   - In the Makefiles, make sure that the installation directories of the dependencies are correct (e.g. NVCC, INSTALL_DIR, MATIO_DIR)
   - Currently, the STL formulations are not compatible with the CUDA option.

2. Numerical Simulations (Matlab):
   -  
   -

3. Hardware Experiments (ROS, Python, Matlab):
   -
   -
