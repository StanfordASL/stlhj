%% Installation %%
- The HJ Reachability computation uses the beacls C++ toolbox, which can be found here: https://github.com/HJReachability/beacls/tree/master/sources
- In the Makefiles, make sure that the installation directories of the dependencies are correct (e.g. NVCC, INSTALL_DIR, MATIO_DIR)
- Currently the STL formulations are not compatible with the CUDA option.

%% Folders %%
- Turtlebot_Car4D_Car1D_Intersection: 
  - Traffic light intersection example as described in WAFR 2018 submission: http://asl/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/Chen.Tam.Livingston.Pavone.WAFR18.pdf
  - Contains files for reachability computation, numerical simulations, and implementation on Turtlebots.

- Turtlebot_Car4D_Car1D_Overtake:
  - Highway overtaking example as described in WAFR 2018 submission: http://asl/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/Chen.Tam.Livingston.Pavone.WAFR18.pdf
  - Contains files for reachability computation, numerical simulations, and implementation on Turtlebots.

- STL Functions:
  - Contains files for temporal operators (i.e. always, eventually, until)

- Test Sample:
  - A quick computation to test whether the installation was successful.

- Old Files:
  - Contains work done leading up to the Traffic light intersection and Highway overtaking examples.
  - Varied approach to the problems posed by the examples..
