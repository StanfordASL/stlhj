%% Create_Fourway_Intersection.cpp %%
- Main script that replaces Car_test.cpp in the original setup.
- Calls fourway_intersection.cpp to assign values to grid points and passes a "Command"
  to the script (0-Green Light, 1-Red Light)

%% fourway_intersection.cpp %%
- Contains the parameters that define the different parts of the intersection:
  - theta_offset: the ideal angle at which the car should be traveling on the road section.
  - lane_offset: the center of the road's longitudinal dimension
  - range: {xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax} the vertices of the road section.
  - enhance: a special case used for the target lane to multiply the values of the
             lane vector by a factor.
- Initializes the value-function vector to a low value (-12).
- The last part of the script where

%% get_subvector.cpp %%
- Obtain the relevant subvector that relates to the road section that we are interested in.

%% add_lane.cpp %%
- Resets the values in the lane vector to 0 when the vector is first processed for
  dimension 0 (x) or dimension 1 (y).
- Takes in the enhance variable to know when to multiply the lane vector by a factor.
- Returns the values assigned to the lane.

%% add_sq.cpp %%
- Resets the values in the lane vector to 0 when the vector is first processed for
  dimension 0 (x).
- Performs a function that outputs a lane vector that has the characteristics of running
  add_lane.cpp for both dim=0 and 1 then taking the max values.

%% theta_diff.cpp %%
- finds the minimum d_theta between the 2 input angles.
